[Third Task]
This "Time-Zone Converter App" is a project that Code Alpha assigned to me as part of Assignment no. 03.
The app allows users to view their current time-zone, which is displayed at the top of the main screen. Users can select their region/country and convert the time to any other selected region by searching for the desired time-zone.  
I have put my best effort into developing this application, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. I appreciate your time in reviewing my work and look forward to your feedback. _Thank you!_
